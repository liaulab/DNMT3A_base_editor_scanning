## Abstract
DNA methylation is critical for regulating gene expression, necessitating its accurate placement by enzymes such as the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A. Dysregulation of this process is known to cause aberrant development and oncogenesis, yet how DNMT3A is regulated holistically by its three domains remains challenging to study. Here we integrate base editing with a DNA methylation reporter to perform in situ mutational scanning of DNMT3A in cells. We identify mutations throughout the protein that perturb function, including ones at an interdomain interface that block allosteric activation. Unexpectedly, we also find mutations in the PWWP domain, a histone reader, that modulate enzyme activity despite preserving histone recognition and protein stability. These effects arise from altered PWWP domain DNA affinity, which we show is a noncanonical function required for full activity in cells. Our findings highlight mechanisms of interdomain crosstalk and demonstrate a generalizable strategy to probe sequence-activity relationships of nonessential chromatin regulators.
